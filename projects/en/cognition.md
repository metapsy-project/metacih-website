**Antipsychotic drugs and their effects on cognitive function: a systematic review, pairwise meta-analysis, and network meta-analysis.**

The project is funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) (FKZ: 01KG2108).

The project aims to compare the effects of different antipsychotics on cognitive function in people with schizophrenia. For this purpose, a systematic review with pairwise meta-analyses and network meta-analyses is planned, in which the different clinically used antipsychotics will be comparatively examined with regard to their effect on parameters of cognitive function. The results of this work will provide an evidence-based decision making basis that will allow the selection of the best treatment option for the individual patient. 

The project is primarily conducted by Lena Feber and Natalie Peter, contact: lena.feber@tum.de, natalie.peter@tum.de

**Supervisor:** Professor Stefan Leucht
