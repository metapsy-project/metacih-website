**Metabolic side effects of antipsychotic drugs in the medium‑ to long‑term treatment of schizophrenia: a systematic review and network meta‑analysis**

Funded by the **German Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF, FKZ 01KG1904)**.

This project investigates how antipsychotics differ in their **metabolic side effects** during medium- to long-term treatment of schizophrenia.

Antipsychotics are a cornerstone of schizophrenia treatment, used in both acute treatment and relapse prevention. However, the differences in medium- to long-term metabolic side effects between antipsychotics are not well understood. These **metabolic side effects** include weight gain and disturbances in lipid and glucose metabolism.

The **network meta-analysis** method allows for estimation of effect sizes for all possible drug comparisons, regardless of whether they were directly compared in a trial, offering a comprehensive review of all available evidence.

The systematic review and network meta-analysis protocol was pre-registered in **Prospero** under **CRD42020175414** (see [here](https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?ID=CRD42020175414)) and published in *BMC Systematic Reviews*:

(2021): Metabolic side effects of antipsychotic drugs in individuals with schizophrenia during medium- to long-term treatment: protocol for a systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials. In: *Systematic Reviews*, 10(1), p. 214. DOI: 10.1186/s13643-021-01760-z ([Link](https://doi.org/10.1186/s13643-021-01760-z)).

Currently, the publication paper with the results of the network meta-analysis is in preparation.

Representatives of the association "**BASTA - das Bündnis für psychisch erkrankte Menschen**" are participating in the project.

The project was primarily conducted by **Angelika Burschinski** and **Dr. Johannes Schneider-Thoma**, contact: [angelika.burschinski@tum.de](mailto:angelika.burschinski@tum.de)

**Supervision:** Professor Stefan Leucht
