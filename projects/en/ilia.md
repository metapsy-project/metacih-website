The project is funded by the Innovation Fund of the German Federal Government (funding code: 01VSF22033) and registered at the German Clinical Trial Register (Registration number:  DRKS00034991). More information [here&#8599;](https://innovationsfonds.g-ba.de/projekte/versorgungsforschung/iris-it-basiertes-rueckfall-monitoring-fuer-schizophrenie.543) (German).

Due to the **high relapse rates among patients with schizophrenia** and the associated high costs, care can be significantly improved through relapse-reducing measures. Guidelines consistently emphasize the importance of identifying early warning signs of schizophrenia, which are known to appear several weeks before a relapse.

As part of the ILIA study, it is being evaluated whether **app-based monitoring of early warning signs** in schizophrenia and their evaluation can lead to behavioral changes in patients and caregivers, ultimately resulting in **fewer rehospitalizations** and reduced treatment costs.

In this **multicenter, randomized controlled study**, 106 patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder are recruited across **six participating study centers**. Participants in the intervention group enter the **ten early warning sign items weekly** into an app on their own smartphone during a twelve-month intervention phase. Both patients and caregivers have access to view the progression of the early warning signs at any time through the app/dashboard. If the total score exceeds a certain threshold, an alert is triggered, notifying both the caregiver and the patient. In this case, the caregiver and patient are advised to establish timely contact, such as through a phone call, to assess the patient's current health status. 

This process represents a **shared responsibility between the patient and caregiver**. As part of a **shared decision-making process**, the next treatment steps should then be jointly decided upon. These may include psychoeducation, improving sleep, issuing a sick note, adjusting antipsychotic medication, or the participatory decision that no further action is needed.
