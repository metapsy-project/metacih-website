**A living online systematic review of scientific evidence about changes in the prevalence of mental health issues due to the COVID-19 pandemic and containment measures.**

The project was funded by the Swiss National Foundation (SNF) through the NRP 78 initiative.

We hypothesize that the length and intensity of social isolation and the fear of infection can have important adverse effects on public mental health. However, large-scale evidence is lacking to-date to support or refute this claim. We currently do not know:

- **a)** what is the prevalence of mental health issues in the general population and subpopulations worldwide during the COVID-19 pandemic,
- **b)** whether the intensity of the pandemic and the stringency of measures to contain the pandemic impact on mental health (and if yes, how),
- **c)** which population and context characteristics (e.g., sex, age, comorbidities, country) modify the impact of the pandemic on mental health.

We systematically review all studies published worldwide that evaluate the impact of the pandemic on public mental health. Up to February 2022, 117 trained volunteer researchers (doctors, psychologists, statisticians, and students) have been involved, screening the literature and extracting data in continuous waves. To date, we have screened more than 40,000 abstracts and extracted data from nearly 300 articles. We present regularly updated summaries of the prevalence of mental health issues during and before the pandemic by country and population. We also present the associations between the intensity of the outbreak (e.g., number of daily cases) and the containment measures (such as lockdown, stringency of social distancing rules) with changes in public mental health.

The protocol of the study was registered a-priori in Prospero under the number **CRD42020180049** (see [here](https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?ID=CRD42020180049)).

In addition to conference and radio pieces, the project so far was presented in an editorial in *European Archives of Psychiatry and Clinical Neuroscience*:

as well as in a commentary in *Lancet Psychiatry*:
