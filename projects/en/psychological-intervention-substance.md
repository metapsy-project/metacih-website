**Psychological and psychosocial interventions for people with schizophrenia and co-occurring substance use disorders: A systematic review and meta-analysis**

The project investigates if psychological and psychosocial interventions are efficacious and tolerable for people with schizophrenia spectrum disorder and co-occurring substance use disorders.
 
The project will include all Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) comparing psychological and psychosocial interventions with a control group such as Treatment as Usual (TAU), waitlist, inactive control, or another psychological intervention. The primary outcome is overall symptoms of schizophrenia and reduction/abstinence of substance use.
 
The protocol of the systematic review was registered in Prospero with ID number CRD42024517885
 
The project is primarily conducted by [Nurul Husna Salahuddin](/team/nurul-salahuddin/)

**Supervisor:** Prof. Josef Priller & Prof. Stefan Leucht
