This project aims to examine the comparative efficacy, acceptability, and tolerability of all psychological and psychosocial interventions in the treatment of schizophrenia patients with treatment resistance through **network meta-analysis**.

The project will include all **Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs)** comparing psychological and psychosocial interventions with a control group acting as a psychological intervention arm, such as Treatment as Usual (TAU), waitlist, inactive control, or another psychological intervention. The primary outcome will be overall symptoms of schizophrenia as measured by rating scales such as the **Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS)**, the **Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS)**, or any other validated scales. The project will ultimately produce a comprehensive rank of all treatments by conducting a network meta-analysis.

The protocol of the systematic review was registered in **Prospero** with ID number **CRD42022358696** (see [here](https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?ID=CRD42022358696)).

The project is primarily conducted by **Nurul Husna Salahuddin**, contact: [nurulhusna.salahuddin@tum.de](mailto:nurulhusna.salahuddin@tum.de)

**Supervisor:** Prof. Josef Priller & Prof. Stefan Leucht
