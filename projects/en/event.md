The project is funded by the **Innovation Fund of the German Federal Government** (funding code: 01VSF19022). More information [here](#).

Selecting the appropriate antipsychotic is a crucial medical decision in the treatment of schizophrenia. This decision requires not only careful **risk-benefit assessments** of different medications but also consideration of the **preferences and values** of the individual patient. Although well-established information exists regarding the efficacy and side-effect profiles of antipsychotics, there is no framework that combines medical evidence on antipsychotics with patient preferences and values within a shared decision-making process.

To address this gap, we have developed an evidence-based tool called the **Shared-Decision-Making Assistant (SDM-assistant)** for selecting antipsychotics. This tool supports shared decision-making by providing and visualizing information about the efficacy and side effects of different antipsychotics, based on high-quality network meta-analysis.

We are currently conducting a **cluster-randomized trial** comparing the use of the SDM-assistant with treatment as usual in hospitalized patients with schizophrenia.

If successful, implementing the SDM-assistant could enhance **evidence-based medicine** in schizophrenia by incorporating patient preferences and values into treatment decisions, leading to improved patient involvement in decision-making and more effective treatment choices.

The protocol was registered a priori in the **German Clinical Trial Register** (ID: DRKS00027316) and published in *BMC Psychiatry*:
