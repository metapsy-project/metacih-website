In today’s ever evolving digital age the phenomenon of “Crowdsourcing” has become widely known. It signifies a group of people (“the crowd”) who provide services, information, or ideas usually via the Internet. We would like to know what motivates participants to join and continue working on such projects in the scientific field voluntarily. 

Therefore, we will conduct this research on crowdsourcing participants of the Mental Health Covid project [“MHCOVID”](https://ebmpp.org/projects/mental-health-covid) – a living systematic review about the prevalence of mental health issues during the pandemic.
