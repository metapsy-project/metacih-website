**Psychological interventions for relapse prevention in people with schizoprenia: Systematic review and network meta-analysis**

The project was funded by the **Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)** (FKZ 01KG1803).

This project investigates the effect and acceptance of **psychological interventions** in the relapse prevention of schizophrenia.

Psychological interventions, such as psychoeducation, family therapy, and cognitive behavioral therapy, are provided alongside pharmacological treatments for maintenance treatment in schizophrenia. However, it has not yet been studied which of these treatments is most effective for preventing relapse.

The **network meta-analysis** method allows for the estimation of effect sizes for all possible comparisons of different psychological interventions, regardless of whether they were directly compared in a trial, allowing a comprehensive review of all available evidence.

The protocol of the study was registered a-priori in **Prospero** under the number **CRD42017067795** (see [here](https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?ID=CRD42017067795)) and published in *BMJ Open*:

Representatives of the association “**BASTA - das Bündnis für psychisch erkrankte Menschen**” participated in the project, and together we prepared this summary of the project, understandable for non-experts.

The project was primarily conducted by **Dr. Irene Bighelli**, contact: [irene.bighelli@tum.de](mailto:irene.bighelli@tum.de)
