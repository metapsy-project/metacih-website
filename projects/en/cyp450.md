Pharmacogenomics has a potential to mitigate many shortcomings of currently available psychiatric drugs by personalization of therapy. Unfortunately, currently available pharmacogenomic clinical guidelines are unclear and often conflicted. Living meta-analysis is the powerful innovative tool that can help provide more precise and more conclusive evidence from the available clinical data in the literature while always being up-to-date as new data emerges in this rapidly evolving field.

The aim of this project will be to establish living meta-analysis series that will compare plasma concentrations of commonly prescribed psychiatric drugs, mostly antidepressants and antipsychotics, between carriers of different variants of genes that code CYP450 enzymes such as CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, etc.

This evidence based, continuously updated, transparent online system will serve as: scientific base for further development of pharmacogenomic tools in psychiatry related to CYP450 enzymes, and as a service that will help psychiatrists anticipate expected magnitudes of drug-gene interactions based on CYP450 genetic results of a given patient.
