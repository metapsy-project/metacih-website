There is a controversy which antipsychotic drug should be preferred for the treatment of schizophrenia. 

We therefore conducted a network meta-analysis of 32 antipsychotics which included 402 acute-phase, randomised-controlled trials and 53463 participants. We found that antipsychotics differ more clearly in side-effects than in efficacy. The hierarchies identified could be useful for drug choice.
