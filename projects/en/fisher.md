**Family interventions for relapse preventions in people with schizophrenia: Systematic review and network meta-analysis**

The project was funded by the **Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)** (FKZ 01KG1803).

This project investigates the effect and acceptance of **family interventions** in the relapse prevention of schizophrenia.

Evidence on family interventions for patients with schizophrenia suggests they serve as a protective factor against psychotic exacerbations and hospitalizations. Various family intervention models exist, including psychoeducational, behavioral, systemic, and other approaches. However, it remains unclear which model is most effective for preventing relapse.

The **network meta-analysis** method enables estimation of effect sizes for all possible comparisons of different family interventions, regardless of whether they were directly compared in a trial, allowing a comprehensive review of all available evidence.

The protocol of the study was registered a-priori in **Prospero** under the number **CRD42020169951** (see [here](https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?ID=CRD42020169951)).

The results of the project were published in *The Lancet Psychiatry*:
