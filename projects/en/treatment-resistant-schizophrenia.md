**A Network Meta-Analysis of Antipsychotic Drugs in Patients with Treatment-Resistant Schizophrenia**

The project is about the efficacy, acceptability and tolerability of both first- and second-generation antipsychotic drugs for treatment-resistant schizophrenia patients.

The project will include all randomized trials (RCTs) comparing one antipsychotic drug with another antipsychotic agent or placebo in treatment-resistant schizophrenia. The primary outcome will be the overall symptoms of schizophrenia as measured by rating scales such as the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) or of any other validated scale. The project will eventually obtain a comprehensive ranking of all treatments by conducting a network meta-analysis.

The project is primarily conducted by Shimeng Dong, contact: shimeng.dong@tum.de. For now, the project is on the procedure of registration. Data extraction is being conducted simultaneously by Shimeng Dong and another colleague in our group.

**Supervisor:** [Professor Stefan Leucht](/team/prof-stefan-leucht/)
