**Evidence on antipsychotic drug treatment for schizophrenia from Western and Chinese trials: building a joint database and applying network meta-analyses.**

Approximately one third of controlled schizophrenia trials nowadays come from China. Unfortunately, it is often not clear whether appropriate randomisation and blinding methods were used. We are trying to elucidate this issue with a joint project with Shanghai Mental Health Center funded by a joint Sino-German grant.

Funding: German Research Foundation and National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)
