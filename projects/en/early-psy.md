**Psychological interventions for early-phase schizophrenia: A systematic review and network meta-analysis.**

The project is funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) (01KG2314). 

The aim of the project is to comparatively investigate the influence of various psychological interventions used in the early phase of schizophrenia. To this end, a systematic review with pairwise meta-analyses and network meta-analyses is planned, in which the different psychological interventions will be examined regarding their effects on specific parameters (such as overall symptomatology, relapses, etc.). The results of this work are intended to provide an evidence-based decision-making foundation that will facilitate the implementation and selection of psychological interventions in the early phase of schizophrenia, potentially contributing to symptom reduction and the prevention of chronicity.
