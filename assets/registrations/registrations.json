        "summary": "The current project aims to examine the efficacy of meditation-based interventions on various outcomes and to create a corresponding database. We will include randomized controlled trials that used a meditation-based intervention lasting at least two weeks or sessions. There will be no exclusions based on outcome, comparator, or population. Within meta-analyses that result from this database, moderator analyses as well as subgroup analyses may be conducted to further understand variations in the effects. ",
