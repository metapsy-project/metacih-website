Rui is a doctoral student in the Section of Evidence-Based Medicine in Psychiatry and Psychotherapy at the Technical University of Munich (TUM). She obtained her masterâ€™s degree in Psychiatry and Mental Health from Jinan University, China, and completed three years of standardized training as a psychiatric resident. During that time, she conducted several research on the pathogenesis and pharmacological treatment of disorders such as anxiety disorder, depression disorder, and especially insomnia disorder.

Her research interests focus on conducting systematic reviews, including pairwise and network meta-analyses, to compare drug efficacy across psychiatric and medical conditions.

Currently, she is working on her dissertation projects, which explore the differences in perceptions of drug efficacy between healthcare professionals and the general public.
