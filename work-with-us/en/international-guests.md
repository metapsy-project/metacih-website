EBMPP has hosted multiple researchers from **various countries** (among others China, Greece, Indonesia, Japan, Spain, Poland, Turkey, Italy) who have spent from a few months to several years with us. Several of them have also **obtained a doctorate degree** or are currently working on it. Our core team members also come from various countries, thus **English is our working language**. 

We find this internationality very inspiring and we want to gather around us committed scientific minds from anywhere in the world.
